- Landing page
- CV page (content from legacy, markup close to legacy)
- Contact page (rewritten, anti-spam baseline)
- Login / minimal admin capability (foundation for future features)
- Container-based local dev (docker-compose)

## Out of scope (removed from MVP)
- Trips
- Drone flights

## Later (post-MVP)
- New pages and features added incrementally
- Production deployment (documented in private OPS repo)
